Weather App README
This is a simple weather app implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can search for weather information by entering the name of a city, and the app displays the temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed for that city.

Files:
index.html: This file contains the structure of the webpage written in HTML, including the navigation bar, search input, and weather information display.
style.css: This file contains the styling rules written in CSS for the webpage, including the layout and appearance of various elements.
HTML Structure:
The HTML file (index.html) consists of a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration indicating that it's an HTML5 document.
It includes a <head> section where meta tags for character set and viewport settings are defined, along with a title for the webpage and links to external CSS and JavaScript files.
The main content of the webpage is within the <body> tag, which includes the navigation bar, search input, and weather information display.
CSS Styling:
The CSS file (style.css) provides styling rules for different elements of the webpage, such as the navigation bar, search input, buttons, and weather information display.
It sets the background color, font styles, padding, borders, and layout for various elements to create a visually appealing design.
JavaScript Functionality:
The JavaScript code (embedded within <script> tags in the HTML file) handles user interaction and data fetching.
It listens for clicks on the search button, retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user-entered city name, and displays the temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.
Error handling is implemented to alert users if there's an issue with fetching weather data.
Usage:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open index.html in a web browser to use the weather app.
Enter the name of a city in the search input and click the "Search" button to fetch and display weather information for that city.
View the temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed displayed on the webpage.
Customize the styling or functionality in the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files as needed.
